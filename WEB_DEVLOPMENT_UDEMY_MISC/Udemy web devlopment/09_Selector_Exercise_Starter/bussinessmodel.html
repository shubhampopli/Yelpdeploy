        <h1>THE BUSINESS MODEL</h1>
        <ol>The first year plan would be to put all the high-demand jobs in the menu option like:-
            <li>Developer Jobs</li>
            <li>Marketing Jobs</li>
            <li>Content Writer jobs</li> 
            <li>Graphic Designer</li>
            <li>This will create a good reputation and spread the word about our platform.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            The second year plan would be to go offline to grab the huge unskilled labor with easy jobs like-
            <li>Standing in a Queue</li>
            <li>Walking a Dog</li>
            <li>Baby Sitting</li>
            <li>Car Washing, etc</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>The third year plan would be to add jobs which have low demands depending on the market forces but high supply. This will provide opportunity to all for earning a living.

In the coming years, we will be providing option for the industries for bulk hiring(Group of people who can do the work efficiently), where they can work over a project and submit a full fledged project at the end.
</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We would generate Profit by our Payment method and commission</li>
            <li>When the Client pays for the job, the Money will be transferred to a “Escrow Account” rather than to the Freelancer’s account.</li>
            <li>Freelancer would get Notified about this and would be incentivized to work judiciously  </li>
            <li>After the work is delivered, the Freelancer would get the fee from which we will take our commission </li>
            <li>The Money in the<span> “Escrow Account ”</span> would earn us security and Revenue</li>

        </ol>
        <h2>Commission Model(Needs More Thought and Work)</h2>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Job<=₹300 :- 10% Commission</li>
                <li>Job<=₹2000 :- 15% Commission</li>
                <li>Dynamic Fee Charging System which will charge anywhere from 20% to 30% Commission from Established and Promoted Free-Lancers who will earn a lot, making their pay consistent enough to consider a settled lifestyle 
   like Youtube having full-time Youtubers
</li>
            </ol>
